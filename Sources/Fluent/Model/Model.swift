/// Represents a single table / collection in a Fluent database. Models
/// are the basis for querying databases (create, read, update, and delete).
///
/// Models can also conform to `Migration` to providing prepare and revert methods for performing actions
/// on the database before the application boots.
///
/// Both `struct`s and `class`es can be models. Since Fluent is closure-based,
/// copied `struct`s will be returned by any methods that must mutate the model.
///
/// Here is an example of a simple `User` model.
///
///     final class User: Model {
///         typealias Database = PostgreSQLDatabase
///         static let idKey: WritableKeyPath<User, UUID?> = \.id
///         var id: UUID?
///         var name: String
///
///         init(id: UUID? = nil, name: String) {
///             self.id = id
///             self.name = name
///         }
///     }
///
/// Most of the time, you should use the Fluent driver's sub-protocols for conforming to `Model` instead of
/// using the protocol directly.
///
/// ## Query
///
/// To create a `QueryBuilder` for a model, use the `query(on:)` method.
///
///     let users = try User.query(on: req).filter(\.name == "Vapor").all()
///
/// You can also create `QueryBuilder`s for any `Decodable` type. However, `QueryBuilder`s created for `Model`s
/// have some extra methods and functionality.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// Models can implement optional lifecycle methods to hook into Fluent actions.
///
///     final class User: Model {
///         ...
///         func willDelete(on conn: PostgreSQLConnection) throws -> Future<User> {
///             print("Deleting user: \(id)")
///             return conn.future(self)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ## Timestamps
///
/// Models are capable of storing timestamps representing when this model was first created and when it was last updated.
/// If you decide to store timestamps on your model, Fluent will automatically update them whenever changes to the database are made.
///
///     final class User: Model {
///         static let createdAtKey: TimestampKey? = \User.createdAt
///         static let updatedAtKey: TimestampKey? = \User.updatedAt
///         ...
///         var createdAt: Date?
///         var updatedAt: Date?
///     }
///
/// Add timestamp keys pointing to the properties on your model to let Fluent automatically update the values.
/// You can set key paths for one or both of the keys per model.
///
/// ## Soft Delete
///
/// Instead of actually deleting rows from the database, soft deleted models can have a "deleted at" property set.
///
///
///     final class User: Model {
///         ...
///         var deletedAt: Date?
///     }
///
///     extension User: SoftDeletable {
///         static let deletedAtKey: TimestampKey? = \.deletedAt
///     }
///
/// You can add `SoftDeletable` to existing models that have an optional `Date` property for storing the
/// deleted at date.
///
/// - note: The deleted at date my be set in the future. The model will continue to be included in
///         queries until the deleted at date passes.
///
/// Use `softDelete(on:)` to soft-delete a `SoftDeletable` model from the database.
/// Use `restore(on:)` to restore a soft-deleted model.
///
///     let user: User
///     try user.softDelete(on: conn)
///     // later ...
///     try user.restore(on: conn)
///
/// Use `excludeSoftDeleted()` on `QueryBuilder` to exclude soft-deleted results (included by default).
///
///     User.query(on: conn).excludeSoftDeleted().count()
///
/// `SoftDeletable` models have extra lifecycle events:
///
///     - `willRestore`.
///     - `didRestore`.
///     - `willSoftDelete`.
///     - `didSoftDelete`.
///
